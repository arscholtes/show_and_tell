This application is being created to show off some features I can build in a weekend that I think might be something I would be doing if I were to get the position at Demandwell.  

-We will be trying to put together the following features

-Webcrawler that can go look at google and see where a specific website is
in terms of how high up it is in the search results.

-Hit twitter's API and collect data about impressions for social media posts
then take that and throw it into a graph showing its growth overtime.

-Create a service that will send a text message as well as an email to predetermined recipients once certain metrics are reached with both of the external data-points. (probably going to be just hard-coded so we dont have to make login stuff or entryforms for email and phone to save on time)

-If time is still remaining learn react and have a few examples of that in
the application.

-If even more time, then see if we can't add a component to the email message
that would enable us to track how long it takes from send until its opened and for how long it is opened and if any hard coded links are touched.

-And just to clarify one of the comments, it was an attempt at humor, I used devise so that I can add the messaging functionality to the project and
I am on a time crunch so yeah, I know CV used to say to not use that gem.

-I found this really cool new thing called hotwire by the way, I will link it but its amazing from what I have seen, its prerelease but sounds like they are launching v1.0 soon.  Trying to do a talk at indy.rb in the future about it once I learn more.
